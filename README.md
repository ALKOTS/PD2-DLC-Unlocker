# PD2-DLC-Unlocker
Unlocks PAYDAY 2 DLCs

# How this works:

On start, creates a dlcs-to-unlock.txt file in your /PAYDAY 2/mods/saves folder. By default has a `"*"` in it, which means all dlcs are unlocked. If you want to unlock only specific dlcs, replace the star with dlc ids from [Steam DB](https://steamdb.info/app/218620/dlc/).
